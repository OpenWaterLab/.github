# Security Policy

The OpenWaterLab (OWL) ecosystem takes security and responsible disclosure
seriously.

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in any OWL repository,
please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report the issue privately by contacting the maintainers of the
affected repository or the OpenWaterLab organization.

We will work to assess the issue and coordinate an appropriate response.

Thank you for helping keep the OWL ecosystem secure.
