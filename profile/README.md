# OpenWaterLab (OWL)
**OpenWaterLab (OWL)** is an ecosystem of **free and open-source software** for **water systems modelling, simulation and analysis**.

Our mission is to provide **high-quality, transparent, and reusable tools** for researchers, engineers, utilities and practitioners working on the modelling and digital representation of water systems.

OpenWaterLab (OWL) is part of the broader activities of **[BIOMATH](https://github.com/UGentBiomath)** research group at Ghent University in Belgium.

## Available tools in OpenWaterLab ecosystem

### **owl-data**
A Python package for analysis, validation, cleaning, gap-filling and visualization of data acquired in the context of water and wastewater systems.

### **owl-twin**
A Python package providing reusable building blocks and automated pipelines for creating and maintaining digital twins of water systems.

### **owl-sim**
A Python package for modelling and simulation of water and wastewater systems.

Additional tools and domain-specific models will be added as the ecosystem grows.

## Vision
OpenWaterLab aims to:

- Support **open, transparent and reproducible** models and tools for water system research and practice.
- Build a **modular and extensible toolbox** for modelling, simulation, analysis and digital twin developments of water systems.
- Encourage **collaboration and knowledge sharing** between researchers, developers, engineers and utilities in the community.
- Lower the barrier to adopting **open digital water technologies** in both research and applied contexts.
